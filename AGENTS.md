**This is `./AGENTS.md`. Your equivalent is `./WIP.md` which must track your plan. KEEP THE PLAN UP TO DATE AS YOU EVOLVE THE CODE. DEVIATIONS TO THE PLAN MUST BE LOGGED WITHIN THE PLAN. THE PLAN MUST BE REASSESSED HOLISTICALLY AFTER ANY CHANGE OF ANY SIZE.**

**ON TOOLS: Use `config.mk` to create custom targets, and the `make` tool to run targets. ALWAYS use custom targets that *limit* the amount of output you receive. For example, piping through tail, with FEW lines output. Prior to tail, pipe to tee. The file ./build.log in the root of the project is gitignored, so use that. That way you can *search* the output. To be clear, timing dependent tests are BANNED. As are those that take too long to run. Testing retries, for example, MUST be done in a way that supports avoiding running afoul of those CRITICAL rules. Abide. OBEY.**

**ON CHECKS: All checks MUST pass AT ALL TIMES. DO NOT PROCEED IF CHECKS ARE FAILING. FIX THE CHECKS IMMEDIATELY. You are SOLELY responsible for ALL checks and ALL behavior. Declaring "it was broken before" is NOT an excuse. FIX IT.**

DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE. This is MY file. You are ONLY allowed to READ this file.

**ALL the contents of `./WIP.md` and `./review.md` (if either exist, including if you create them) are MANDATORY changes/tasks that MUST be completed _in full_ IMMEDIATELY _without fail_.**
