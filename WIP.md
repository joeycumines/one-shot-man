# WIP - Takumi's Work Diary

## Current Goal
Fix all test failures including:
- Example 5 test expectation (expectations wrong, not code)
- PA-BT race conditions and timing issues
- Ensure make-all-with-log passes
- Ensure make-all-in-container passes

## High Level Action Plan
1. Initial assessment - find failing tests
2. Fix Example 5 test expectations
3. Fix PA-BT race conditions
4. Verify both make targets pass 100%
5. Update blueprint and WIP to completion
