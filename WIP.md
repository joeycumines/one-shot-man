# WIP.md

## Current Goal
Fix DEFECT 1 described in `./review.md`: confirm the precise fix, implement code changes and test fixes, and ensure all checks/tests pass reliably (use `make-all-with-log` target).

## Action Plan (checklist)
- [ ] Update WIP.md (this file)
- [ ] Analyze DEFECT 1 in `./review.md` using runSubagent and confirm exact fixes
- [ ] Implement the agreed fix(s) in source code
- [ ] Run `make-all-with-log` and fix any failures
- [ ] Use runSubagent to determine appropriate tests/test fixes and verify tests
- [ ] Implement tests and test fixes
- [ ] Rerun full checks and ensure reliable pass
- [ ] Finalize and update `./review.md` and documentation

## Progress Log
- 2025-12-27: WIP.md created and initialized. Started DEFECT 1 workflow; next: analyze DEFECT 1 using runSubagent (todo 2).
