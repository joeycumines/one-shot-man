Ensure, or rather GUARANTEE the correctness of my PR. Since you're _guaranteeing_ it, sink commensurate effort; you care deeply about keeping your word, after all. Even then, I expect you to think very VERY hard, significantly harder than you might expect. Assume, from start to finish, that there's _always_ another problem, and you just haven't caught it yet. Question all information provided - _only_ if it is simply impossible to verify are you allowed to trust, and if you trust you MUST specify that (as briefly as possible). Provide a succinct summary then more detailed analysis. Your succinct summary must be such that removing any single part, or applying any transformation or adjustment of wording, would make it materially worse.
